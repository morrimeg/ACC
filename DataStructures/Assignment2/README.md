## Character Chain

This program asks the user for a string and inputs the user's string into a linked list character by character. 
The user then has options to see the length of the list, find a character in the list, append a new list
to the current list, and see if a new string is part of the current list.

**Running the Code**
Note that I am running the code on a Mac/Unix system. Your compiler commands may be different
```
g++ -o charchain charchain.cpp
./charchain

```
