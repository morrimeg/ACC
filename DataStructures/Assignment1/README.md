## Max Array


This program creates and runs a function that recursively finds the maximum value in an array.
The function is a tempalte function, so it can take in any type of data.


**Running the program**

To run the program, use the following command (this works on Mac/Unix systems, so you will need to make sure you have the 
right compiler installed for your system):

```
g++ -o maxarray maxarray.cpp
./maxarray

```
