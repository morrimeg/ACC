## Tic Tac Toe Game

This folder contains my main project from my Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 class at ACC. 

 This program will get two users to play a game of tic tac toe. The program will run
 until one of the players wins (3 of the same values in a row) or there is a
 tie (all spots on the board are filled, but none of the same values are 3 in a row).
 
 Users play the game by entering in the cell position on the board (e.g. 2,2).
 
 **Running the Program**
 Note: I am using a Mac, so your compile commands may be different.
 
 In order to run the code, run the following commands:
 ```
 g++ -o tictactoe L4_morrison.cpp
 ./tictactoe
 ```
